# Pocket Money Management System

## Overview

In Kenya, pocket money is an essential aspect of a high school student's life. However, the existing system for distributing and managing pocket money has significant shortcomings, including vulnerability to cash theft among students, mismanagement of funds, and occasional failures in money disbursement. While efforts have been made to mitigate these issues through cashless transfers using bank cards, this approach has not gained widespread acceptance, particularly in rural areas where some parents have yet to adopt banking services.

This project presents a solution aimed at revolutionizing how pocket money is managed in Kenyan high schools. The proposed system utilizes a mobile application to facilitate seamless transactions between parents and school vendors. Parents can deposit funds directly into their child's student account through the app and child can authorize transactions with a secure password. This innovative approach not only reduces the risk of cash-related problems but also encourages greater parental involvement in monitoring their child's daily spending habits.
